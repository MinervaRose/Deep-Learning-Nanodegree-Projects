After being awarded one of the 10,000 seats of the [PyTorch Scholarship Challenge from Facebook](https://www.udacity.com/facebook-pytorch-scholarship), I had the honor of being selected, along with 300 lucky fellow students, to pursue the Deep Learning Nanodegree by Udacity.

Together with Udacity, Facebook invested in a scholarship program that enabled students to acquire cutting-edge skills in deep learning using Pytorch, a popular, fast-growing open-source deep learning framework that provides a seamless path from AI research to production deployment.

During the first phase of this program, students took the Udacityâ€™s "Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch" course, and created a Flower Classifier as a capstone project. In the second phase of the program, the students who earned a full scholarship to the Deep Learning Nanodegree studied Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, Deployment, and more. Students used PyTorch, and had access to GPUs to train models faster, as they learned from authorities like Sebastian Thrun, Ian Goodfellow, Jun-Yan Zhu, and Andrew Trask.

Some of the projects in the present repository were done in the Udacity workspace, some in Google Colab, and the implementation of the sentiment analysis model was carried out in AWS Sagemaker.
